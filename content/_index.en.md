amenities:
  - title: "Beach"
    image: "/images/activities/playa.jpg"
    description: "Walk down to the beach right below the neighbourhood — golden sand, crystal-clear water, and barely a soul around. Craving more buzz? Playa del Barco is right next door, lively and sun-soaked. Explore the hidden coves tucked between the rocks in front of La Pedrera, or cross to the other side and discover El Desplayado, where the horizon opens wide and the ocean is all yours."
  - title: "Surfing"
    image: "/images/activities/surf.jpg"
    description: "The waves start right at the neighbourhood beach and multiply in every direction. El Desplayado offers mellow sandy-bottom peaks. Just 7 km away, La Aguada in La Paloma delivers gentle, consistent waves — the perfect spot for kids to take their first lessons at the local surf school. South of La Paloma, a string of beaches caters to every level and taste: from hollow barrels to endless right-handers."
  - title: "Kitesurfing"
    image: "/images/activities/kitesurf.jpg"
    description: "When the warm northeast wind blows, the beach in front of the neighbourhood becomes your private kite arena. On southerly days, La Aguada and La Paloma Bay offer flat water and endless room to ride. There's a kite school for beginners and those looking to level up — picture yourself carving across the water as the sun dips over the Atlantic."
  - title: "Wingfoil"
    image: "/images/activities/wingfoil.jpg"
    description: "La Paloma Bay is a natural wingfoil paradise: calm waters for learners and, at the mouth of the bay, challenging waves for the experienced. When the sea is mellow, you can also glide silently over the water at the neighbourhood beach, with nothing but the foil and the wind for company."
  - title: "Tennis"
    image: "/images/activities/tennis.jpg"
    description: "Hard court right inside the community, with floodlights so you can keep playing after a long day at the beach. Grab your racket, set up the mate, and enjoy a set with friends while the sky turns orange."
  - title: "Kids' Playground"
    image: "/images/activities/juegos.jpg"
    description: "Little ones have their own corner of adventure: outdoor play equipment surrounded by greenery, where laughter and imagination know no bounds. While they play safe and happy, you can sit just a few steps away with a coffee or a book, the sound of the sea your only soundtrack."
